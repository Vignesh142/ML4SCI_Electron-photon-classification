https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/FbXw3V4XNyYB3oA (electrons)

Description: 32x32 matrices (two channels - hit energy and time) for two classes of
particles electrons and photons impinging on a calorimeter

Please use a deep learning method of your choice to achieve the highest possible
classification on this dataset (we ask that you do it both in Keras/Tensorflow and in
PyTorch). Please provide a Jupyter notebook that shows your solution. The model you submit should have a ROC AUC score of at least 0.80.
